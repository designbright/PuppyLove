# PROJECT "PUPPY LOVE"

If you are new to coding, this is a great project to use. Feel free to fork or clone my repo!
This project focuses on basic HTML layouts and CSS styling elements

Your task is to review index.png and index.html and to write the CSS to match the mockup provided

## Resources

The resources folder contains files designed to help you complete the activity. This will include screen shots of the completed HTML and files containing the text.

### Screen Shots

Screen shot of the final code are provided for reference. Feel free to compare your rendered code with the screen shots as you work to try and determine if you are on track.

- *index.png* is a screen shot of the rendered HTML after it has been styled with CSS.

### Starter Files

The starter files contains the complete HTML file, image folder, and a blank linked style sheet. Work out of this folder, but don't edit the HTML. Your goal is to add styles to the style sheet to match *index.html*.
